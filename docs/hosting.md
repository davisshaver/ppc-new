Kinsta uses <a rel='nofollow' href="https://kinsta.com/blog/google-cloud-hosting/?kaid=ZVESVRKWBCMV">Google Cloud Hosting</a> to provide on-demand scalability should you see a sudden spike in traffic. 

Google Cloud does well in <a rel='nofollow' href="https://kinsta.com/blog/google-cloud-vs-aws/?kaid=ZVESVRKWBCMV">a head-to-head comparision with AWS</a>, and when coupled with Cloudflare <a rel='nofollow' href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/install-cloudflare/?kaid=ZVESVRKWBCMV">Cloudflare</a> the result is a site that's speedy at the edge AND the application layer.
